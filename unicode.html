            <h1>Unicode</h1>
            <p>
                Unicode is a text format designed to standardise binary representation of
                every glyph in every language, so that every device can display any character
                correctly. Additionally, it provides support for small images, known as emoji,
                which can not only be displayed, but also modified in various ways.
            </p>

            <h3>History of Unicode</h3>
            <p>
                Before Unicode, the latin alphabet (the ABC's) were encoded using a standard
                known as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, or ASCII for
                short. This standard used 7 bits to encode each letter's uppercase and lowercase
                forms, digits and punctuation, as well as some additional control codes which were
                used to determine line breaks and such. 7 bits allowed for 128 different characters
                and codes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The standard's first edition was published in 1963, and was followed by multiple
                revisions until 1986. During this time, ASCII was the main method of information
                interchange within English-speaking countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the introduction of 8-bit and 16-bit computer systems, ASCII was amended to
                use a full byte, or 8 bits, to represent each character. This allowed the standard
                to be extended and include an additional 128 characters. New standards were introduced
                which could include non-latin characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the 8-bit representation was still limited as it could usually only represent
                two separate scripts at most for a given standard. In some cases, such as
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters">Chinese or Japanese</a> which
                have thousands of unique characters, even 8 bits per character was insufficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                A draft proposal in 1988 introduced the idea of Unicode, a text encoding standard
                for all of the world's languages. The initial idea used 16 bits per character,
                giving 65,536 different characters. The standard was first published in 1991 by
                the newly established <a href="https://home.unicode.org/">Unicode Consortium</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1996, Unicode 2.0 was published, and with it a new encoding system which removed
                the 16-bit restriction. This allowed for the inclusion of over a million new
                characters, such as hieroglyphs and Chinese characters which were seldom used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before Unicode, Japanese phone networks had their own standards to support the
                thousands of characters they used. In addition to their script, they were able
                to allocate some values to small images which they called emoji. In 2007, the
                Unicode Consortium was pressured by US phone manufacturers to add emoji to the
                standard so that they could compete in the Japanese phone market.
            </p>

            <h3>Modern Relevance</h3>
            <p>
                The current version of Unicode is 13.0, which includes a total of 154 different
                scripts as well as thousands of additional characters for notation in subjects
                such as mathematics or music, as well as thousands of emoji.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to Unicode, and everyone who is involved in developing the standard,
                communication is possible on a global scale. Thoughts and ideas can easily be
                transferred from one language to another, even giving rise to online translation
                services such as <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=Unicode%20is%20an%20amazing%20feat%20of%20humanity">Google Translate.</a>
