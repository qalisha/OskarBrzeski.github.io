      <h1>Crime</h1>
      <p>One relatively new implementation of technology is within the policing sector, in order to track crimes more quickly.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
      <p>Crime detection has really benefitted from the developments in Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition namely
          To conclude whether a crime is a one off, or a spree/ serial offence, police and intelligencce agencies have resorted to using 
          technology to determine this. Rather than a human manually searching through past crimes to find a connection with a current one, 
          pattern recognition technology facilites tracking crimes more quickly, and perhaps spot patterns that otherwise might have gone unnoticed.
          For example, in New York, a seemingly random crime of a thief using a syringe as a weapon had been connected to several other robberies, miles away.
          This connection was made by pattern recognition software called Patternizr, whereby an investigator can very quickly compare robberies, larcenies
          and thefts to thousands and thousands of past crimes, therefore finding a pattern within them.
          Another important aspect they had to consider when implementing this method,is the removal of racial bias, to avoid any such bias, the race of the suspect is not 
          compared when looking for a pattern. This may even be a fairer detection of crimes in comparision to humans own racial bias.

      <h3>Data Mapping & Smartphone Tracking</h3>
      <p>
            The trend of data mapping isn’t new; in fact, weather and climate scientists have been doing it for decades. However, criminal justice professionals are also data mapping now, providing police departments as well as federal agencies with a clear geographical look at the types of crime and the volume of crime that happens in an area. This is beneficial to law enforcement because it shows trends that may be able to be traced back to certain locations; drug rings are a prime example of how data mapping can be useful to the police. It also helps the police pinpoint problems in a community and allows them to strategize effectively to help reduce crime.
            <p>
            While there is some debate about when and how smartphone tracking should be utilized by law enforcement, the ability to track a criminal through the use of their smartphone is an incredible advancement in technology. This technology, when accessed through legal channels, can provide law enforcement with a clear picture of a suspect’s movements before, during, and after a crime. For those innocent of the crime they are accused of, the technology can save them from a criminal trial; for those who are guilty, the tracking capability of this common object can seal their fate.
