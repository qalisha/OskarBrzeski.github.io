<h1>The Positive Impact Of Computer Science: Healthcare </h1>
<h3>Some of the uses of computers in medicine are: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Electronic medical records</li>
    <li>Medical imaging (Ultrasound) </li>
    <li>Surgical procedures</li>
</ul>
<h3>Electronic Medical Records: </h3>
<p>
Electronic medical records improve quality of care, patient outcomes, and safety through improved management, reduction in medication errors, 
reduction in unnecessary investigations, and improved communication and interactions among primary care providers, patients, and other providers 
involved in care. Electronic medical records improve the work lives of family physicians despite some subjective concerns about implementation 
costs and time. Electronic medical records have been demonstrated to improve efficiencies in work flow through reducing the time required to pull 
charts, improving access to comprehensive patient data, helping to manage prescriptions, improving scheduling of patient appointments, and providing 
remote access to patients’ charts. Electronic medical records capture point-of-care data that inform and improve practice through quality improvement 
projects, practice-level interventions, and informative research.
</p>

<h3>Medical Imaging (Ultrasound): </h3>
<p>
  Medical imaging is a broad term that covers technology used to create images of the human body for study and diagnosis. It includes magnetic resonance 
  imaging (MRI), ultrasound, CT scans and X-Rays. All of these devices are controlled by computers. Even X-Ray imaging, which has been used in medicine 
  since the early 20th century, now uses computers for image adjustment and transfer. Medical imaging or diagnostic imaging has greatly advanced health 
  care in the last 30 years. With its use, doctors can accurately identify injuries, conditions, and diseases in their early stages. This is especially 
  useful for conditions that are asymptomatic and do not display any symptoms. Because of its ability to offer quicker and more reliable information, 
  diagnostic imaging has drastically improved patient outcomes and helped doctors achieve better results. The technology used in diagnostic imaging is 
  not used for diagnosis purposes only. Diagnostic imaging benefits not just patients but also healthcare providers. Medical imaging guides doctors in 
  surgery for improved precision and accuracy.
</p>

<h3>Surgical Procedures: </h3>
<p>
  Computers are used to assist in planning, teaching and performing many surgical procedures. One of the biggest recent developments in this area is 
  robotically-assisted surgery (RAS), which allows surgeons to use robotic devices and computer software to complete minimally-invasive procedures. The 
  surgeon remains in control and guides the robot device to complete complex operations in confined parts of the body. The robot provides your surgeon 
  with an increased level of dexterity and allows them to operate in small spaces inside your body that would otherwise require open surgery. Compared 
  to traditional open surgery, robotic surgery results in smaller incisions, which reduce pain and scarring, lead to less time spent in the hospital and 
  quicker recovery times. However, it doesn’t only provide benefits to the patient. Your surgeon also greatly benefits from robotic surgery, gaining 
  enhanced precision, flexibility, control and vision. It also allows your surgeon to perform very delicate or complex surgical procedures that may have 
  been very difficult or even impossible without the aid of the robot.
