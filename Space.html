<h1>The Positive Impact Of Computer Science: Space </h1>
<p>
It’s not too infrequent when talking about space exploration that we hear about how our phones are more powerful than the rocket used in Apollo 11,
but launching technology into space hasn’t stayed fixed to exploration, instead we have almost 3000 satellites orbiting earth performing various
tasks for us, from The Hubble Space Telescope to GPS satellites, they’re all a feat of computational innovation.
</p>
<h3>Additional examples of computer science being used in space are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Scientific research using data within space</li>
    <li>Unmanned space exploration such as rovers to Mars</li>
    <li>Spacecraft that can be controlled digitally to allow for easy access</li>
</ul>
<h3>Satellite Internet</h3>
<p>
The first commercial communcations satellite was launched in July 1962, and since, many have been sent up in order to support communications around Earth.
Many satellites used for these purposes are geosynchronous, which means that they orbit Earth and travel with the Earths rotation, so they stay above one
fixed point on the Earth at all times. However, in recent years more low orbit satellites have been developed which would decrease latency when connecting
to them and these will be set up in constellations to allow access from any point on Earth. Although we aren't quite there yet, this is looking to be a
real possibility in the future to able to access high speed, low latency internet connectivity from anywhere on Earth, without requiring current network
masts dotted around the area.
</p>

<h3>Unmanned space exploration</h3>
<p>
Unmanned space exploration begun in 1958 with the explorers program by NASA. It was created to place a scientific satellite into orbit in order to complete
many experiments in space. Since then, with an increase in computational power and affordability, many other unmanned space missions have happened and we
have been able to send robots to other planets. For example, in 2011, NASA launched the curiosity rover to Mars, which landed in 2012. It has since been
assessing the habitability of mars and has been able to analyze samples of the surrounding environment. This has allowed us to gather images of Mars which
we may not be able to do in person for many more years. The image below is the view of "Mount Sharp" on Mars, taken in September 2015:
